    <p> Greetings! And a warm welcome to my webpage.<p>
		
		<p> I am a physicist by training, with a Ph.D in astrophysics, a data enthusiast
		and am currently working in the coding education sector &mdash; introducing the opportunity 
		to learn coding within public libraries in Bangladesh. </p>
		
        <p> I was previously a researcher in astrophysics at Durham University. 
        During my PhD I was researching the galaxies at the centre of clusters of galaxies. 
        More information about my research can be found on the 
        <a href="Astrophysics.html" title="Astrophysics">Astrophysics</a></li> 
        section of this webpage.</p>
        
    <p> My undergraduate studies were in Maths and Physics at the University of Warwick. </p>

     <p> I am an avid reader, of both fiction and non-fiction. 
     See my <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/25830284-tim-green" 
     title="Goodreads Profile">Goodreads profile here</a>.</p>
      <p> 
      <p> I like to do photography as a hobby. The World around me has always fascinated me 
      (with the drive to understand how it works leading me toward the study of physics) 
      and photography is all about capturing those wonders around us. Photography is also a 
      satisfying blend of artistic (finding an eye pleasing scene) and technical considerations 
      (considering the physics of the light and optics involved for example). 
      Some of my photos can be seen in the 
      <a href="Photos.html" title="Photos" >photography</a> section of this webpage. </p>

     <!--<p>I am also a very keen foodie. One of life's greatest pleasures is the excitement of trying new foods & drinks, of discovering new aromas, flavours and textures. I enjoy cooking, I enjoy the endless satisfaction of combining ingredients together to create something new and better than the sum of its parts. I am rarely happier than when I am wandering around a food market, sampling new things and talking to people who are passionate about their produce. </p>
     In particular I study clusters of galaxies. These are systems where hundreds, if not thousands of galaxies are gravitationally bound together. My specific focus is on the galaxy at the very centre of clusters of galaxies. These are called Brightest Cluster Galaxies (a.k.a BCGs)and are the most massive galaxies in the Universe. I study how the properties of these galaxies, such as star formation history and central supermassive black hole activity are linked to the enivoronment they reside in. </p>
