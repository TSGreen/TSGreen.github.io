    <p> My research area was observations of clusters of galaxies, with a particular focus on the massive galaxy at the centre, known as the Brightest Cluster Galaxy (BCG). </p>
     <p>Clusters of galaxies are systems where hundreds/thousands of galaxies are gravitationally bound together.</p>
       <p>My research focuses on the properties and evolution of Brightest Cluster Galaxies at the centre of clusters. These are the most massive galaxies in the Universe and occupy a unique environment at the centre of the gravitational pull of the cluster.</p>
       <p> Brightest Cluster Galaxies are generally considered to be "red and dead". This means they have only undergone star formation in the early Universe, when they first formed, and have been evolving passively (not forming new stars) since. As a result they only contain old (red) stars.</p>

	<p> However, clusters have a lot of hot gas between the galaxies, known as the Intracluster Medium. This gas is so hot that it emits X-rays which transport a lot of energy away. In some clusters this X-ray emission is so bright in the core that the gas cools significantly. Under gravity this cool gas is drawn toward the central galaxy. Then, since cool gas is the main ingredient in forming new stars, you get star formation in the central galaxy. However, it is still disputed how common this phenomena is. </p>
	<p> I have recently published a journal article in which we study the colours of nearly 1000 Brightest Cluster Galaxies. What we find is that a significant number (14%) actually exhibit colours consistent with young stars or accretion onto the central supermassive black hole of the galaxy. This suggests that perhaps BCGs are not as "red and dead" as generally reputed.</p>
	<p> A link to the paper can be found <a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/doi/10.1093/mnras/stw1338" title="Photometric Census of Activity in BCGs">here</a> </p>

    </div>
	<p> Another topic of debate is how Brightest Cluster Galaxies grow over time. Theory suggests that BCGs grow significantly over time due to merging with other galaxies. However the number BCGs observed to be merging doesn't appear to match the numbers predicted from theory. My current work involves an investigation into possible galaxy-galaxy mergers in the centre of clusters. I am using IFU spectroscopy to measure the speeds of galaxies to determine whether they are indeed merging and if so, over what timescales does this happen. </p>
